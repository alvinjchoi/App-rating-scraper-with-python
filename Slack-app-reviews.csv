I wish I could put the channels in the order we use them the most, instead of the app just putting them where it wants. 
I had an issue with posting pics and tech help was friendly and got back with me quickly. The problem was resolved in a week or so. 
My biggest complaint is the app is bad about not giving notifications when it should. This is a real problem as many employees will not check the app unless it notifies them something has been posted.

1,RufHaus71,"The recent iPad App update misses the mark quite considerably. In some ways, it is almost as if Slack doesn‚Äôt understand its users. No longer easy to see all unread messages in one place - which was a feature I regularly requested for the desktop app. Now, the iPad app has been turned to be quite bland. Seems like the ‚ÄúDark Mode‚Äù folks won the design argument; as the new app no longer supports the desktop or web app color themes; which now makes the iPad app incredibly difficult to know at a glance which team you‚Äôre viewing. Also frustrating are the 3 or so ‚ÄúUnread Direct Messages‚Äù you can see, when you tap ‚ÄúShow All‚Äù it takes you to the ‚ÄúDirect Messages‚Äù sidebar that sorts in its own way, with unreads strewn about. Also, Direct message addresses are much harder to read; too much text all clumped together. Unfortunate for the iPad app, Slack has taken a once very useful version (preferred as a second screen in some cases over the desktop app) and made it into a giant iPhone app. The iPhone app now also suffers from this Direct Message unread messages ‚ÄúShow All‚Äù problem. The only way to return some of the missing sort and see all DMs on the iPad app is to select the sort option of ‚Äúby recent‚Äù but it does not group unreads. 7 years using Slack, and this is by far the most disappointing iPad app ‚Äúupgrade.‚Äù Repackage the desktop app for the iPad and call it ‚ÄúSlack Pro‚Äù for iPad Pro users who use their iPad in place of a laptop.",False,2,"One Step Forward, Two Steps Back for iPad",2022-04-14 14:50:10,

3,Just Your Usual Reviewer,"Post-acquisition the Slack iOS app has taken something of a nosedive in quality. It went from a nearly full featured Slack client to kind of a baby-mode limited functionality version with fewer and fewer options and features. Theming is gone and the UI is stuck in high contrast mode that gives you awful visual afterimages. The ability for workspace owners to do anything is gone. The ability to control editing window behavior is gone. Hardware keyboard integration is worse, with shortcut keys being removed. It's become riddled with bugs. Just scrolling the chat will randomly throw one of your messages into edit mode if you touch it wrong. Every couple of versions it stops accepting Return to send when using a hardware keyboard. I'm glad Stew and his folks sold out and made a bunch of money, that's awesome, I like Stew personally but it's a shame what the clueless new owners are doing with the software they bought.

4,Emayteeteex,"Look, I love/d Slack. I‚Äôve been using it as my internal business communication tool for the past five years. I‚Äôve also noticed in those past five years, Slack has barely innovated and as of recently, especially during 2020 when most applications like zoom, Google meet, and Microsoft teams have been booming with innovation in new ways of interacting in this new work from home work life. Now with the acquisition from salesforce, I truly feel like Slack is going to go down the drain and what was once the industry leader in communication has sat back on the couch, slacking, watching everybody else move forward. As of today, we are looking into other platforms outside of Slack due to the lack of innovation and buy out from sales force. An example of what I think is easy innovative feedback, we‚Äôve been asking for voice clips to send both privately and in channels up to 2 to 5 minutes long so managers can leave a status update or important message or daily briefing first thing in the morning without having to type it all out and can do it on the go; nothing.

5,Ayrton117,"Overall the app works quite well. Some things are big misses for me though, especially notifications. Putting a lot of detail in hopes it is read by developers as I do want to love the app.

Searching for users when trying to start a DM doesn‚Äôt prioritize users you‚Äôve talked to before. I work at a company with thousands of employees, so if I search for someone with a common first name and I don‚Äôt know their last name, I have to go through a list of 30 people when I‚Äôve talked to them before and I‚Äôd expect them to just come up first.

Messages you read on web or on the app don‚Äôt dismiss notifications. I have to go dismiss them all one at a time even though the app should know I‚Äôve read them. Big failing for me compared to something like FB messenger which will know to clear them.

There are no different snooze settings for different days of the week. I don‚Äôt work 7 days a week. Why would I want the same snooze settings?

There is no granularity on getting alerts for channels besides give me everything all the time, and give me nothing. If a conversation is happening I want to know about it, but I also don‚Äôt want my phone to completely blow up with 50 notifications beeping at me in 10 minutes. It would be much less distracting / annoying to group the messages and notify on configurable intervals

Lastly, if I get a message while snoozed I am not told about it once the snooze ends. This can lead to me not noticing a message for days",False,3,Good except for notifications,2020-06-07 16:17:55,

However, recent updates changed the behavior of unread messages in a way that makes it extremely aggravating to use.

Unfortunately, when you tap the link to ‚Äúshow all x‚Äù it takes you to the DMs screen where messages are in chronological order.

10,TheDelayFish,"The Slack service is great but the ios app needs either a better thoughtout navigation system or more customizations. There‚Äôs so many little things that could be slightly tweaked to make this a better experience.

For instance, all unread channels and 1:1 conversations are automatically moved to the top of the list, which means the list is constantly shifting around, making it very difficult to find the channel I need or go back to the previous channel after switching briefly to see a new message. And when I look for a particular conversation or channel, I have to check two places. The desktop slack app (thankfully) offers an option to turn this off, but not the mobile app.

Settings for the whole app are buried inside channels/conversations. Settings for channels, at least to some degree, are only available on the desktop app. It‚Äôs a mess.

And editing a message requires a long press and then a quick tap on a menu that‚Äôs partially covered by the home indicator on the iPhone X/11.

Sometimes my workflow is interrupted by a not-so-helpful on-screen tip, like the one showing me how to swipe horizontally. (I already knew that, and I have work to do.) There‚Äôs no way to turn these off or quickly dismiss them, so I must complete each exercise before I‚Äôm allowed to use the app.

I was not pleased when Microsoft purchased Skype, and my fears were increasingly justified as I saw version release after version release further thrash GUI conventions (if Microsoft made light switches, down would turn the light on and up would turn it off...). Finally, the family decided to stop using Skype for our domestic and international communications needs. We switched to Slack...

Second, my review:
It took some getting used to, but Slack is now our family communication hub... we‚Äôve got channels for making travel plans, sharing recipes, and even communicating while playing Minecraft (yes, I know, Microsoft...).

Slack has not only replaced Skype, but is quickly replacing our need to use generic texting and e-mail.  I‚Äôm still very fond of Discord, but who knows...!?

For some unfashionable reason, the iOS app splits the list of channels I'm in into two groups: ones that have unread messages and ones that don't.

That's not the case with a Mac app.

The result is that there's A TON of scrolling back and forth, trying to find the channel I'm looking for, since it can be in two places: with new messages and without new messages.

Then, there's ""starred"" channels, which have the same problem.

The UI is a nightmare. I spend more time scrolling through twice as many items on my list of channels than I do on my Macbook! And there's no option in settings to disable this.
